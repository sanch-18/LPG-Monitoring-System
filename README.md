# LPG-Monitoring-System
LPG monitoring system is an Iot based system to measure the percentage of LPG gas present in a LPG cylinder and to alert the user about the LPG Leakage if it is present. I used ESP32 Microcontroller in this project along with MQ135 sensors, Load cell, buzzer and Blynk as a 3rd Party application to transfer the data. Here is the Arduino code.
